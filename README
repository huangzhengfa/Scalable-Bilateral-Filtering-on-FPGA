Requirments:
Vivado 2015.3 or above
Matlab R2010 or above

Run using vivado:

Vivado Initalizing-
Open Vivado
Create new project
Click next
Set Project location as <current source foler>
Click next
Select RTL project
Click next
Add files in source code, tick copy sources into folder
targate language: VHDL Silumator language: VHDL
Click next
Add files in IP folder
Click next
Add files in constraint folder
Select Boards: ZYNQ7-ZC706 Evaluation Board
Click next
Click finish

Generate core ip-
Goto sources window in Project Manager in Vivado
Right click to ip and select 'Upgrade IP'
Tick 'convert ip to core container'
'Generage Output Product window will Popup'
Click Generate to genetate IP
Do this for all IP blocks

Setup GPA Filtering Parameter-
goto line no 70 gpf_main.vhd
set img_s as image width (m)
set win_s as kernal size (w*w)
set sigr as spatial kernal parms (sigma_r)
set Nmax as Filtering order (N)

Functional simulation process-
Genegate test binary file from test image as shown in 'img_in.txt'
You can use matlab file 'image_gen.m' to generate it.
Copy img_out.txt to sim/ folder.
Run behaveral simulation.
It will 'img_out.txt' file in sim/ folder.
You can read 'img_out.txt' file 'image_read.m' to read and display output file.

Synthesis and Implimentation process-
Run systhesis and wait till it completes
Open synthesis design put Timing constrain and set clock frequency
Note post synthesis results
Run implimentation and wait till it complets
Note post implimentation resource consumption and timing
